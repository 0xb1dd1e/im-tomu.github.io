# Licensing

For more details, please read the license that is included with the software,
hardware or documentation.

## Software

All Tomu software is [open source and free software](https://opensource.org/)
but different software is under different licenses. This means that it is not
only available for download free of charge, but you have access to the source
code and may modify and redistribute our software subject to certain
restrictions.

## Hardware

All Tomu hardware is [certified open hardware](http://certificate.oshwa.org/certification-directory/).
This means that you have access to the source code and may modify and
redistribute our hardware subject to certain restrictions.

## Documentation

All Tomu documentation and other non-code resources is
[creative commons](https://creativecommons.org).

## Preference

The Tomu project believes strongly in the value of
["share alike" licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share-alike)
and will use them in preference to other licenses. This is just our preference,
we understand the arguments of our friends in the
["permissive" license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_licence)
camp and do actively contribute and collaborate with them!

## Trademarks

Our policy is taken directly from the Mozilla foundation's trademark policy and
we believe it is consistent with our open source philosophy.

Although our code is free, it is very important that we strictly enforce our
trademark rights, in order to be able to protect our users against people who
use the marks to commit fraud.

Our trademarks include, among others, the names Tomu, the phrase "I'm Tomu", as
well as the Tomu logo, and the Tomu robot (including variants). This means
that, while you have considerable freedom to redistribute and modify our
software, there are tight restrictions on your ability to use the Tomu names
and logos in ways which fall in the domain of trademark law.

For more detail on our trademark licensing, see our Trademark Policy. If you
still have questions after reading the policy, please contact
[trademarks@tomu.im](mailto:trademarks@tomu.im).
